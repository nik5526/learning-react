React is called a single page component.
# Two types of routing in web apps are
- Client side routing -- in client side routing it does not make a network call because it already has that data(about page ,ContactUs page) inside our app so that's why it is very fast. 

- Server side routing -- in server side routing it relods the whole page and send the network call to the about.html and fetch the data and render it to the webpage.
