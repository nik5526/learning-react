React is called a single page component.
# Two types of routing in web apps are
- Client side routing -- in client side routing it does not make a network call because it already has that data(about page ,ContactUs page) inside our app so that's why it is very fast. 

- Server side routing -- in server side routing it relods the whole page and send the network call to the about.html and fetch the data and render it to the webpage.

 # now we will create our own hooks - it is used for optimizing our app.
- First we will delete the function that is fetching the api .
- Then we have to create the component in the utility section and there we have to add our fetch data hook .
- Make sure to initialise the name with the hook name that is best practise.
- Name custom hooks with use word, as react also reccomend us to do that ,we can name it anything but   Â Â good practice is to use the (use) keyword at the start of the naming.
